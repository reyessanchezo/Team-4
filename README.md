In collaboration with Cardinal/Fastenal, Team 4 is designing a system that controls the movement of a bolt clamp to algin with a bandsaw for specified cuts. At this stage, we are using a Teknic ClearCore I/O and Motion controller with a ClearPath Servo to move a carriage along a ball screw. The HMI is a 4D systems 4.3 Inch Touchscreen LCD running off of the clearcore. 

The programs contained are written on the foundation of code publicly available from Teknic and 4D Systems.

#How to use
The ClearCore is programmed using the Arduino IDE. In order for it to function properly,
